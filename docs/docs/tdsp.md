# Team Data Science Process (TDSP)

The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. TDSP helps improve team collaboration and learning by suggesting how team roles work best together. TDSP includes best practices and structures from Microsoft and other industry leaders to help toward successful implementation of data science initiatives.

## TDSP Lifecycle

The TDSP lifecycle is composed of five iterative stages:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Acquisition and Understanding
3. Modeling
4. Deployment
5. Customer Acceptance

## TDSP Documentation

If you chose to include TDSP documentation in your project, you'll find the following files in the `docs/tdsp` directory:

1. `project_charter.md`: Defines the project, including its business background, problem statement, goals, and success criteria.

2. `data_dictionary.md`: Describes the data that will be used for the project, including its source, schema, and any relevant metadata.

3. `data_report.md`: Provides a summary of the data exploration and preprocessing steps, including data quality assessments, feature engineering, and any insights gained from the data.

4. `model_report.md`: Documents the modeling process, including algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and final model performance.

These documents serve as templates and should be filled out as you progress through your data science project. They help maintain clear communication within the team and with stakeholders, ensure reproducibility, and document important decisions and findings throughout the project lifecycle.
